        <p><b>The chicken </b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl,
            is a type of domesticated fowl, originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an
            adult male
            bird.
            A younger male may be called a cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female
            bird is
            called a hen.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken">"Chicken</a> was originally a term only for an immature,
            or at
            least young, bird,
            but thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now become the most common term for the subspecies in
            general,
            especially in American English. In older sources common fowl or domestic fowl were typically used for
            this.

        <h3>Behavior</h3>
        <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
        <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks.
            They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
            Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order",
            with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations.
            Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new
            pecking
            order is established.
            Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.<sup><a
                    href="somesource.com">[30]</a></sup>
            When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first.
            He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food.
            This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.</p>
        <h4>Crowing</h4>
        <p>Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although it is possible for a hen to crow
            as
            well,
            crowing (together with hackles development) is one of the clearest signs of being a
            rooster.<sup>[33]</sup></p>
